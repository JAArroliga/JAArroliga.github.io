            This site is dedicated to explaining the CRAP principles of website design and comparing and contrasting two websites.
        </p>

        <p>Crap Principles stands for: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The elements on the page should be distinct enough to be able to distinguish them from one another.</li>
            <li>Repitition: Intentional recurrance of a specific element in design creating a sense of unity throughout the webpage.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The arangement of the elements on your webpage so that they are in an orderly and non-cluttered manner.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Related items should be close to eachother while unrelated items should be kept seperate. </li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Bad CRAP Website: <a href = "https://www.cnn.com" target= "_blank">CNN.com</a></h3>
            <p>
                The CNN website violates a couple of the CRAP principles. It specifically, repitition, alignment, and proximity. 
                As you can see in the image, the articles are about completely different topics with only two of them being similiar. 
                While the topics might be new or current they are all over the place in tone and importance causing a sense of discord.
                For alignment, the website has margins but each column is a different place and size while the nav bars at the top have completely different margins.
                As for proximity, the articles are all clustered together giving a sense clautrophobia and the amount of next next to each other is overwhelming.
