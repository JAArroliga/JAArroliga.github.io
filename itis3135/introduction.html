        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I was born in Miami, Florida but moved to Knightdale, NC when I was 4 and have lived there ever since. After taking a coding camp at NC State I grew to like programming and wanted to pursue that as a career. When not at school I’m usually taking care of family, hanging out with friends, or playing video games.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> During my years at community college before UNCC I worked at my local Food Lion and later the Office Max as a cashier so that I could save up money. I used to volunteer at a Karate school and help teach the younger students martial arts and self defense during high school.</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b>  I graduated high school Spring of 2020 and went to UNCC however because of COVID and personal matters I returned home to do community college instead. After a couple years I came back with enough credits to be a junior and should be graduating in the Fall of ‘25.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b>  Windows 10 PC and Laptop</li>
            <li><b>Courses I&#39;m Taking, & Why:</b>

                    <li><b>ITIS &#45; 3135 Web&#45;Based Application Design & Development:</b>  While i wanted to get into corporate software, I viewed being a freelance webdeveloper as a good fall back so I was really interested in taking this class</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS &#45; 3130 Introduction to Human&#45;Centered Computing:</b>  Teaches important lessons in making websites and software more readable and accessible to anyone who would use it.</li>
